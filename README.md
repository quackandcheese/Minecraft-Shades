## About
A mod for Minecraft that adds the 'shade' mechanic from Hollow Knight.

Instead of dropping all of your items when you die, a 'Shade' spawns at your death location, holding all of your items & experience levels. However, it won't just hand your loot over, you have to successfully kill it without dying.

A Shades' health matches the value of your max health when you died, and will attack you with the same item/weapon as the one you are currently holding. If you die before killing your Shade, a new Shade appears at the new death location and the old one disappears, along with your old Shade dropping its loot at your old death location (configurable to be more similar to Hollow Knight, where you lose your old loot forever).
